Patient Registration System--Project Description

 The Patient Registration System is a software application designed to manage and store patient details efficiently in a healthcare setting (such as hospitals, clinics, or diagnostic centers). The system provides a structured way for hospital staff to register new patients, maintain records, and retrieve information quickly.

 Key Features:

1.Patient Registration:
Collects basic details such as name, age, gender, address, phone number, and emergency contact.
Stores medical information like blood group, allergies, existing diseases, and insurance details.

2.Unique Patient ID Generation:
Each patient is assigned a unique ID for easy identification.

3.Database Management:
Patient details are stored in a database (e.g., MySQL) for quick retrieval and updates.

4.Search & Retrieval
Staff can search patients using name, ID, or contact number.

5.Update & Delete
Allows modification of existing patient information or removal of records if required.

6.User Authentication
Only authorized staff can access the system to ensure data privacy.

 Objective:

To reduce manual paperwork in patient management.
To make hospital workflows faster and more accurate.
To ensure data security and quick accessibility of patient information.

 Use Case Example:

A patient arrives at the hospital → Staff enters patient details into the system → The system generates a unique patient ID → The patient’s details are saved in the database → When the patient returns, staff can easily retrieve the record using ID or name.

OOPs concept:

Class & Objects → Patient, Doctor, RegistrationSystem.

Encapsulation → Private patient data with getters/setters.

Inheritance → Person → Patient / Doctor.

Polymorphism → Method overriding (display), overloading (register).

Abstraction → Interfaces for hospital operations.
